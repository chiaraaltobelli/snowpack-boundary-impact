# GENIE HOUSE RULES
- Be concise: max ~6 sentences unless I ask for more.
- Prefer step-by-step bullets over prose.
- Code style: clean, small pure functions, SOLID where relevant, no side effects unless necessary.
- Languages:
  - Python: type hints, docstrings, no global state.
  - TS/JS: strict types, small components, no implicit any, functional style.
- Testing: include minimal unit tests for non-trivial functions.
- Output: no filler text; if uncertain, state assumptions first.
- When editing code, show only the diff or the final file (not both).
